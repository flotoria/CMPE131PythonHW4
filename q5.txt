1. The change in increment_int_a will not change the variable a.
2. The change in increment_int_b will change the variable b.
3. In 1, a value, 1, is being passed through, and you cannot simply change an immutable value; meanwhile, in 2, an actual object, the list is being passed through, so when you modify whatever is in the parameter (a list), it will change the list itself.
